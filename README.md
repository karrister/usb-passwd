USB-passwd
=============

Project for a small USB device that attaches directly to the USB-A port of a PC.

The device acts as a USB HID/keyboard. With the press of a button, it inserts the passphrase,
configured by the user on the memory of the PIC microcontroller through USB-UART interface.

The device has two physical buttons, and thus supports two separate passwords to be configured.
